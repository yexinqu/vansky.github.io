I am a graduate student of [linguistics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am interested in Historical Linguistics and Syntax. Currently I am working on correlatives in Vedic Sanskrit
Outside of work, I enjoy travel, dinner parties, and gardening.
